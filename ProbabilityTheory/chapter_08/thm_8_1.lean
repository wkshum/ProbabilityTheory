\begin{thmbox}{8.1}
Suppose $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{F})$, $(\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{G})$, and
$(\Omega,\mathcal{H})$ are measurable spaces in which all singletons are
measurable. There is a unique measurable map
\[
h:(\Omega,\mathcal{H})\to (\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y},\mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G}),
\]
which yields a morphism from any coupling $(\Omega,\mathcal{H},\mu)$ of
$(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{F},P)$ and $(\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{G},Q)$ to
$(\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y},\mathcal{F}\times \mathcal{G},h_{\#}\mu)$.
\end{thmbox}

\textit{Proof} We define the function $h:\Omega\to \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$
for any element $\omega\in \Omega$ as $h(\omega)=(X(\omega),Y(\omega))$. This
function is measurable, meaning that for any measurable rectangle $E_1\times E_2$
in $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$, the inverse image $h^{-1}(E_1\times E_2)$ is
measurable. Specifically, $h^{-1}(E_1\times E_2)$ can be expressed as the
intersection of $X^{-1}(E_1)$ and $Y^{-1}(E_2)$, both of which are
$\mathcal{H}$-measurable sets.

Suppose $(\Omega,\mathcal{H},\mu)$ is a coupling of $(P,Q)$. By definition,
$X$ is a measurable map from $\Omega$ to $\mathcal{X}$ such that $X_{\#}\mu=P$,
and $Y$ is a measurable map from $\Omega$ to $\mathcal{Y}$ such that $Y_{\#}\mu=Q$.
\[
\Omega
\]
\[
\overset{X}{\swarrow} \qquad \downarrow h \qquad \overset{Y}{\searrow}
\]
\[
\mathcal{X} \qquad \xleftarrow{\pi_1} \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y} \xrightarrow{\pi_2} \mathcal{Y}
\]

Consider the push-forward measure $h_{\#}\mu$ on $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$.
By the definition of the functions $\pi_1$ and $h$, we have $\pi_1^{-1}(E_1)=E_1\times \mathcal{Y}$ and
\[
h^{-1}(E_1\times \mathcal{Y})=X^{-1}(E_1).
\]

Therefore, for any $E_1\in \mathcal{F}$, we have $(\pi_1\circ h)^{-1}(E_1)=X^{-1}(E_1)$,
and thus
\[
\mu((\pi_1\circ h)^{-1}(E_1))=\mu(X^{-1}(E_1))=P(E_1).
\]

The last equality follows from the definition of coupling, which proves that the
$(\mu_1\circ h)_{\#}\mu=P$.

By a similar argument, we can show that $(\pi_2\circ h)_{\#}\mu=Q$.

To show the uniqueness of $h$, we fix an element $x\in \mathcal{X}$ and an element
$y\in \mathcal{Y}$. Since $\{x\}$ is a singleton, it is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable, and similarly, $\{y\}$ is $\mathcal{G}$-measurable. An element $\omega$ in the intersection of $X^{-1}(\{x\})$ and $Y^{-1}(\{y\})$ must be mapped to $(x,y)$ in $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$. To see this, we can set $P$ to be the Dirac measure concentrated at $x$ and $Q$ to be the Dirac measure concentrated at $y$ (see Example 3.3.4). The Dirac measure $\mu$ that is concentrated at $\omega$ is a coupling of the two Dirac measures $P$ and $Q$. In this case, defining $h(\omega)$ to be $(x,y)$ is the only way to satisfy the requirements $(\pi_1\circ h)_{\#}\mu=P$ and $(\pi_2\circ h)_{\#}\mu=Q$, thereby establishing the uniqueness of the function $h$. \hfill $\square$
