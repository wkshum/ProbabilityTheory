\begin{thmbox}{7.4 (Dominated Convergence Theorem)}
For $n=1,2,3,\dots$, let $X_n(\omega)$ be
$\bar{\mathbb{R}}$-valued measurable functions defined
on a measure space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu)$, converging
almost everywhere to $X(\omega)$,
\[
X_n \to X \quad \text{a.e.}
\]

If there exists a nonnegative integrable function $Y$
such that $|X_n|\le Y$ a.e. for all $n$, then

(1) $X$ is Lebesgue integrable, i.e., $X\in L^1(\mu)$, and

(2)
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int X_n\, d\mu = \int X\, d\mu = \int \lim_{n\to\infty} X_n\, d\mu.
\]
\end{thmbox}

\textit{Proof} By the assumption that $|X_n|\le Y$ a.e.,
we can find for each $n$ a measurable set $E_n$ such that
$\mu(E_n^c)=0$ and $|X_n(\omega)|\le Y(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in E_n$. Also, we can find a measurable set $E_0$ such that $\mu(E_0^c)=0$ and $X_n(\omega)\to X(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in E_0$. For $\omega$ in the set $E\triangleq \cap_{n\ge 0} E_n$, we have $|X_n(\omega)|\le Y(\omega)$ and $X_n(\omega)\to X(\omega)$.

We next observe that $X_n$ is integrable for all $n$,
since $\int |X_n| \le \int Y < \infty$.

Although we do not know the value of $X(\omega)$ for
$\omega \in E_0^c$, we may set $X(\omega)$ to $0$ for
$\omega \in E_0^c$ without loss of generality. Since
$X_n(\omega)$ converges to $X(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in E_0$ by assumption, the function $X$ is a measurable function. (See the remark at the end of Section 7.1)

Consider the difference $|X_n-X|$. By applying the triangle
inequality for real numbers, we have
\[
|X_n(\omega)-X(\omega)| \le |X_n(\omega)|+|X(\omega)| \le 2Y(\omega)
\]
for each $\omega \in E$. Hence $2Y-|X_n-X|\ge 0$ almost everywhere. By Fatou's lemma,
\begin{equation}
\int \liminf_n (2Y-|X_n-X|) \le \liminf_n \int (2Y-|X_n-X|).
\tag{7.2}
\end{equation}

Since $|X_n-X|\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$, the left-hand side equals $\int 2Y$, and the right-hand side becomes
\[
\liminf_n \left( \int 2Y + \int -|X_n-X| \right)
=
\int 2Y - \limsup_n \int |X_n-X|.
\]

In the last step, we have pulled out the constant $\int 2Y$, which does not depend on $n$, and change liminf to limsup. Because $\int 2Y$ is finite, we can subtract it from both sides of (7.2) to obtain
\[
0 \ge \limsup_n \int |X_n-X|.
\]

The limsup of a sequence of nonnegative real numbers $\int |X_n-X|$ should be nonnegative. Hence, $\limsup_n \int |X_n-X|=0$, and this is possible only when $\int |X_n-X|$ is actually converging to $0$,
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int |X_n-X| = 0.
\tag{7.3}
\end{equation}

By the triangle inequality for real numbers and monotonic property for integrals,
\[
\int |X| = \int |X-X_n+X_n| \le \int |X-X_n| + \int |X_n|,
\]
which holds for any positive integer $n$. By (7.3), for any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we can choose a sufficiently large $n$ such that $\int |X-X_n|<\epsilon$. We then use the assumption that $|X_n|\le Y$ to see that $\int |X| \le \epsilon + \int |Y| < \infty$. Therefore, by Theorem 6.6, $X$ is integrable. This proves (1).

We apply the triangle inequality (Theorem 7.1) to get
\[
\left|\int X_n - X\, d\mu\right| \le \int |X_n-X|\, d\mu.
\]

Because $\int |X_n-X|\, d\mu \to 0$ as $n\to\infty$, we have $|\int X_n - X\, d\mu|\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$. This is the same as saying that $\int X_n\, d\mu \to \int X\, d\mu$ as $n\to\infty$. This proves the equalities in (2) and completes the proof of the dominated convergence theorem. \hfill $\square$
