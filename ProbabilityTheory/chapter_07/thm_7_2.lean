 # Theorem 7.2   Measurable functions with zero norm

-/

\begin{thmbox}{7.2 (Measurable Functions with Zero Norm)}
Suppose $X$ is a real-valued or complex-valued measurable
function defined on a measure space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu)$.
Then, the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item $\int_{\Omega} |X|\, d\mu = 0$.
    \item $X$ is equal to $0$ almost everywhere, i.e.,
    there exists a measurable set $A$ with $\mu(A)=0$
    such that $X(\omega)=0$ for all $\omega \in A^c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thmbox}

\textit{Proof} Suppose $X=0$ almost everywhere. Let $A$ be
the set mentioned in the theorem. We have
\[
\int |X| = \int_{A^c} |X| + \int_A |X|.
\]

The first term is zero because $X(\omega)=0$ for all
$\omega \in A^c$. To show that the second term is zero,
we consider nonnegative simple function $f$ that is pointwise smaller than the function $|X|1_A$. We can write $f(\omega)$ as $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i 1_{E_i}(\omega)$, where $E_i$ is a measurable set inside the set $A$. Since $A$ has measure $0$, all sets $E_i$'s have measure zero, and hence the integral of $f$ is zero. Because it holds for all simple functions $0\le f\le |X|1_A$, the Lebesgue integral of $|X|$ over $A$ is zero.

Conversely, suppose $\int |X|=0$. For each positive integer
$n$, we let $E_n$ denote the event $\{\omega : |X(\omega)|\ge 1/n\}$. The event $E_n$ has measure zero, because
\[
0 = \int |X|\, d\mu \ge \int_{E_n} |X|\, d\mu \ge \int_{E_n} (1/n)\, d\mu \ge (1/n)\mu(E_n),
\]
which is possible only if $\mu(E_n)=0$. We can take the set
$A$ in the theorem to be the union $\cup_n E_n$, which has
measure zero. Then $X(\omega)=0$ for all $\omega \in A^c$.
\hfill $\square$

/-- ## Theorem 7.2
for a measurable real- or complex-valued function,
the nonnegative Lebesgue integral of its norm is zero
iff the function vanishes almost everywhere.
We model the absolute-value integral using the lower Lebesgue
integral `lintegral` of `ENNReal.ofReal ‖X‖`.
