# Errata of "Measure-theoretic probability"

## Chapter 1 

- p.11. Theorem 1.4. On the right-hand side of the equation, the function $f(\alpha)$ should be $f(x)$.

- p.14. In Example 1.3.2, the function $\alpha_2(x)$ for $x$ between $-1.5$ to $1.5$ is defined as $\int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}\, dt$, which is the same as the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable.

## Chapter 2

- p.28 first line. The interval on the left hand side of the equation is $(-\infty, b]$.

- p.31 line 2. "... we can wrte $x$ as $x = y+r_1 \bmod 1$".

## Chapter 3
- p.35. In Theorem 3.1, last sentence, the condition $E \in \mathscr{F}$ should be $E \in \mathscr{F}_0$. The condition is for all events E in the algebra $F_0$.

- p.36. In the proof of Theorem 3.2, line 4, the intersection of  $(-\infty, x_i]$ should be $(-\infty, x]$, not $(-\infty, x_i]$

- p.39. In the last line of the statement of Theorem 3.5, $\sigma$-subaddtivity should be $\sigma$-subadditivity.

- p.43. line -15. In Example 3.3.6, the slope 1/6 should be 3/2.

## Chapter 4

- p.63. line 17, replace $s+\epsilon$ by $s-\epsilon$.
